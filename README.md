🗣️ Hidden Markov Models & Bayesian Estimation for Dysarthric Speech Recognition!(https://www.google.com/search?q=https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Completed-success)A comparative study of Generative (HMM, Bayesian GMM) vs. Discriminative (Random Forest) models for classifying pathological speech using acoustic feature engineering and PCA clustering.📋 Table of ContentsAbstractKey Features-(#-system-architecture)-(#-datasets)Installation & UsageMethodology-(#-results--analysis)-(#torgo-dataset-results)-(#rawdyspeech-dataset-results)Comparative PerformanceContributors📄 AbstractDysarthria is a motor speech disorder resulting in poor articulation and reduced intelligibility. Standard speech recognition systems often fail on such atypical speech due to high intra-speaker variability. This project implements a robust pattern recognition pipeline to classify Dysarthric vs. Control (Healthy) speech.We bridge the "Perceptual-Statistical Gap" by comparing:Hidden Markov Models (HMM): For temporal sequence modeling.Bayesian Gaussian Mixture Models (BGMM): For probabilistic clustering with Dirichlet Process Priors.Random Forest (RF): For non-linear discriminative classification.Our results demonstrate that Random Forest achieves state-of-the-art accuracy (~88%) by effectively handling non-linear feature interactions in a PCA-reduced space, while Bayesian GMMs offer superior robustness against overfitting in data-scarce scenarios.🚀 Key FeaturesHybrid Feature Extraction: Extracts MFCCs (spectral envelope), F0 (pitch), and Formants (F1-F3) to capture articulatory blurring and monopitch.Dimensionality Reduction: Uses Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to retain 95% variance, eliminating multicollinearity for probabilistic models.Statistical Validation: Implements Welch's t-test to statistically validate feature differences between healthy and pathological groups ($p < 0.05$).Advanced Modeling:Bayesian GMM with Dirichlet Process priors for automatic component selection.Random Forest with balanced class weighting for robust decision boundaries.⚙️ System ArchitectureThe project follows a linear processing pipeline designed for modularity and scalability:Input Layer: Raw Audio (.wav) ingestion.Preprocessing: Resampling (16kHz), Normalization, Silence Removal.Feature Extraction: Librosa-based extraction of MFCCs, Pitch (YIN), and LPC Formants.Transformation: PCA for orthogonalization and noise reduction.Classification: Parallel training of HMM, BGMM, and RF models.💾 DatasetsThe project utilizes two distinct datasets to validate model generalization:DatasetDescriptionSamplesCharacteristicsTORGOAcoustic & Articulatory data from speakers with Cerebral Palsy / ALS.~17,600High Class Imbalance, Variable Noise Conditions.RAWDysPeechPre-processed raw waveforms (derived from UASpeech).~160,000Balanced Classes, High Sampling Rate (44.1kHz).🛠 Installation & UsagePrerequisitesEnsure you have Python 3.9+ installed.1.

🔬 Methodology1. Feature ExtractionWe extract a 17-dimensional feature vector for every audio frame:MFCCs (1-13): Represents the shape of the vocal tract. Dysarthric speech often shows "blurred" MFCC trajectories.F0 (Fundamental Frequency): Detects "monopitch" (low variance) common in Parkinsonian dysarthria.Formants (F1-F3): Detects "vowel centralization" (reduced articulatory space).2. Dimensionality Reduction (PCA)The correlation matrix revealed high multicollinearity between MFCC coefficients. We applied PCA to project the data into an orthogonal space, retaining 95% of the variance. This is crucial for the Bayesian GMM to function correctly (as it assumes diagonal covariance).3. Modeling StrategyDiscriminative: Random Forest (100 trees) to learn complex decision boundaries.Generative: Bayesian GMM to model the probability density of "healthy" vs "pathological" speech using priors to prevent overfitting.Temporal: HMM to capture the sequence of speech states (onset -> nucleus -> coda).📊 Results & AnalysisTORGO Dataset ResultsClass Distribution & Feature Analysis<div align="center"><img src="results/torgo_class_dist.png" width="45%" alt="Class Distribution"><img src="results/torgo_features.png" width="45%" alt="Feature Distributions"></div>Observation: The dataset is heavily imbalanced (2:1 Control vs. Dysarthric).
